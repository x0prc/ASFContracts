# ASFContracts
Advanced Simulation &amp; Fuzzer for Smart Contracts

This repository demonstrates how to implement advanced simulation, fuzzing, and invariant testing for Ethereum smart contracts. It leverages Foundry for fuzz/invariant testing and Echidna for property-based fuzzing, enabling security-focused development with automated and rigorous testing.

## Features
- Solidity contract development.
- Foundry-based fuzz and invariant tests.
- Echidna property-based fuzzing integration.
- Automated corpus collection, coverage, and reporting.
