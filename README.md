# ASFContracts
Advanced Simulation &amp; Fuzzer for Smart Contracts

This repository demonstrates how to implement advanced simulation, fuzzing, and invariant testing for Ethereum smart contracts. It leverages Foundry for fuzz/invariant testing and Echidna for property-based fuzzing, enabling security-focused development with automated and rigorous testing.

## Features
- Solidity contract development.
- Foundry-based fuzz and invariant tests.
- Echidna property-based fuzzing integration.
- Automated corpus collection, coverage, and reporting.


## Usage

### 1. Install Dependencies

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std

npm install ethers dotenv
# Install Echidna for fuzzing
brew install echidna
# Or use Docker
docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)":/src ghcr.io/crytic/echidna/echidna
```

---

### 2. Build Contracts

```
forge build
```

---

### 3. Run All Tests

- Foundry unit, fuzz, and invariant tests:
  ```
  forge test
  ```

- Echidna property tests:
  ```
  echidna-test echidna/SimpleBankEchidna.sol --config echidna/config.yaml
  ```

---

### 4. Deploy Contracts

- Add your RPC URL and private key to `.env`:
  ```
  PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
  RPC_URL=https://your-rpc-url
  ```

- Run the deployment script:
  ```
  node scripts/deploy.js
  ```

---

### 5. Advanced Scripting & Helpers

- Use utilities in `src/helpers.js` for ether conversion, address generation, and automated funding:
  ```
  const { toWei, fromWei, randomAddress, fund } = require('./src/helpers');
  ```

---

### 6. Coverage, Corpus & Analysis

- Review coverage and generated corpus in the `coverage/` directory.
- Analyze test results and refine contracts based on invariant/property violations and fuzzing outputs.
